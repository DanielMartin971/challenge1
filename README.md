# Challenge 1 || HTML & CSS

## Description

This is the first challenge/homework we had to do for the class. In it we were expected to organize the CSS file change the HTML to not be as repetitive, add comments to the CSS explaining some of the workings going on to make the webpage look nice! I ended up solving that the HTML page contained too many divs and had a footer that was not needed. I saw that the CSS looked messy, certain classes weren't together and that some of the CSS could've been closer together to make it easier to navigate and find what you're working on.

## Installation

I had to clone the code from the link provided in the Bootcamp. From there I had to input the folder into VS Code and look over the files to see what changes needed to be made. Commited the changes needed, cleaned up the CSS, and got rid of the extra divs in the HTML that were not needed.

## Usage

To use this mock-up page, you just go to the deployed URL to see the page. With the codes to HTML and CSS, you just click on the files in the repo to view the comments in the CSS and to see the changes to the HTML.

## Credits

For help with the README I used: https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide 
It gave me a good idea on how I wanted the README to look like.

The instructions were a bit confusing for the challenge so I asked some classmates for some help or if I was reading things wrong and to get put into the right direction; Brandon Littlejohn gave a good push in the right direction and was able to explain the instructions in a way that made sense to me.
